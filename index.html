                <p>Two years ago I had a bad habit of waking up late for work.</p>
                <p>Every morning was the same — I’d start my work shift, do the mundane work, and count the hours until I could sign off. In the evenings, I played video games.</p>
                <p>The next day, the cycle would repeat.</p>
                <p>Nowadays I still play a lot of video games but I also wake up early and study or write every day before my 9–5 starts. My behaviors changed which led to a new job with a 40% pay rise and moving into an apartment that I didn’t have to share with strangers. Life didn’t get easier, it got busier, but in the best way possible.</p>
